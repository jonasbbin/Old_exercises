# Disclaimer:
Note this is a collection of old machine learning problems. These exercises were solved in a group or on my own. Due to computational or other constraints the chosen approach might not be most effective one.

Each exercise has it's own directory and contains the code used to solve the problem. The data to the respective exercises cannot provided. However, each solution was able to pass the baseline of the exercise.
