# Disclaimer:
Note this is folder also contains multiple old machine learning problems. These exercises were solved in a group or on my own. Due to restrictions from the exercise or computational constraints the chosen approach might not be scoring one.

Each exercise has it's own directory and contains the code used to solve the problem. The data to the respective exercises cannot provided. However, each solution was able to pass the baseline of the exercise.
