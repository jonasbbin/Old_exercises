In this task we need to predict the probability of seven different bodytypes. The original dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aravindpcoder/obesity-or-cvd-risk-classifyregressorcluster). For this competition another artificially generated dataset was used.
## Our Approach:
We analyze our data and use different models for our prediction and use an ensemble to predict our final solution.
