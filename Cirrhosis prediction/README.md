# Disclaimer:
This was an old exercise. Therefore it might be possible that current approaches largely differ from this approach. Also keep in mind that this task was solved under potential restrictions (solution approaches, model usage, hardware, time).
# Cirrhosis prediction
In this task we need to predict the probability of three different outcomes in the cirrhosis disease. We have different medical measurements and patient data for the prediction task
## Our Approach:
We analyze our data and use different simple models for our predictions. The final accuraccy could can be further improved by ensembling the different models.
