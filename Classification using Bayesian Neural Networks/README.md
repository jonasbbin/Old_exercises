# Disclaimer:
This was an old exercise. Therefore it might be possible that current approaches largely differ from this approach. Also keep in mind that this task was solved under potential restrictions (solution approaches, model usage, hardware, time).
# Classification using Bayesian Neural Networks
The aim of this exercise was to implement and train a Bayesian Neural Network, using the derived solutions in class. We were given a template which fixed the structure of our programme.
