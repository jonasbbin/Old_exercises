# Disclaimer:
This was an old exercise. Therefore it might be possible that current approaches largely differ from this approach. Also keep in mind that this task was solved under potential restrictions (solution approaches, model usage, hardware, time).
# Active Learning
The aim of this exercise was to implement an active learning process using Gaussian Processes. We were given a template on which we had to implement discussed formulas.
